### Weather Forecast Website

👨‍💻 **What was developed**

I developed a weather forecast website by consuming data from an API. The WeatherAPI was utilized for fetching weather data, and an API key was generated and stored securely in a `.env` file for authentication.

⚛️ **Technologies and Tools**

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- WeatherAPI (for weather data)
- dotenv (for managing environment variables)
